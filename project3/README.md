# Project # 3
Name:  Cosc 5730
Desription of project:
Its a calculator program. 
The user will be enter numbers, both integer and real numbers. The calculator has the following functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power of, negate. Example of what the user enters and it displays.
9 (shows 9) + (no change in display) 70 (shows 70) = (shows 79)
2 (shows 2) + (shows 2) 2 (shows 2) / (shows 4) 2 (shows 2) = (shows 2)

It also has the standard function of storing and retrieving a value from memory (normally shown as M [memory store] and MR [memory recall] on most calculators). When M is pushed, it shows the current value shown in memory. When the MR is pushed, then that number is used as if it was just typed.

Example: 8 M, so 8 is now stored in “memory”.
         9 + M (shows 8) = 17
Clear: Clears everything: operators, memory, and sets it back to zero.
Del: Clear the number that was just typed in, but not the operator.
Example: 9 + 9 Del 80 = 89. 42 Del 8 + 9 = 17
