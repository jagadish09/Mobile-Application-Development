Anything that doesn't work:




# Grade

* Transactions: 25/30
  * No Catergory verification, so Add/update may not work -5
  * Query/Delete: Working.
  * User expected to know what the catergory numbers are.  No list of category to select anywhere (see UI below).
  * money transfer works, but fails on category verfication as well.
* Categories: 15/20
  * Add/update/delete may work, but no way to tell from user code (test show it looks to work).
* Other problems: -5
  * The UI is very hard to use and must remember what things are.  update screen is confusing and make no sense until it is explained.
* **Total: 35/50**
